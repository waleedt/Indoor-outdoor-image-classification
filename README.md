# Indoor/outdoor classification of images using global image features and various classifiers

Various classifiers are used to experiment how good they can classify an input natural image as being indoor or outdoor. For this purpose we employ global image features, specifically GIST and CENTRIST, which, to explain intuitively, encode the general 'shape' of an image. Good classification performance is achieved by employing these global features in conjunction with various classifiers.
